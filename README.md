# SVG

### this is a playground for designing/testing custom SVG's and animating them

Currently I'm creating a SVG image that will serve as an overlay with interactive elements that will be built with JavaScript. This overlay will serve as a welcome screen to my portfolio/projects. I currently have only a rough idea of how I will use this exactly but the goal is to create and animate the image that's made from scratch so that prospective employers get a good first impression of my design and coding skills.
