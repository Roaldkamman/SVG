# SVG

### this is a playground for designing/testing custom SVG's and animating them

Currently I'm creating a SVG image that will serve as an overlay with interactive elements that will be built with JavaScript. This overlay will serve as a welcome screen to my portfolio/projects. I currently have only a rough idea of how I will use this exactly but the goal is to create and animate the image that's made from scratch so that prospective employers get a good first impression of my design and coding skills. 

Project evolve timeline: 

- created a dozen different designs of the svg and ended up using a svg without background and using a background image within CSS instead for flexibility. 

- final version of SVG has a 100, 100 viewbox and is set to scale to 100 vw vh using CSS.

- transform origin doesn't become fixed using 50%, 50% in CSS so I learned about greensock/gsap. Right now I tested it and the transfor origin is better but still not completely fixed. I need to learn more about animating using gsap in order to get this right. The hover effect using .hover() is also far from identical to a CSS :hover transition. 

- this turned out to be a project in itself. So far it took my 7 days to learn about SVG creation up to the point where I have a SVG that will scale correctly within the browser. 

- I lined up several resources +- 2 days worth of learning material explaining gsap in more detail. I will go through that and hopefully I will have achieved my end goal at the end of that.
